Skinning
Alec Jacobson

Cocoa and GLUT applications wrapping the Skinning class for prototyping linear
blend skinning and other real time deformations methods.

Dependencies
  igl_lib (IGL group's header library)
    AntTweakBar (OpenGL GUI toolkit)
    Eigen3 (matrix library)
  Cocoa (UI on Mac OS X)
  OpenGL (realtime rendering)
  *GLUT (extra openGL utilities: displaying text)


Compilation notes
  Eigen's Block.h was giving some warnings, so I've temporarily turned of
  warnings for implicitly converting 64-bit types to 32-bit types:
  GCC_WARN_64_TO_32_BIT_CONVERSION
